```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F)

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)

incomparable_master      <- readRDS("/Users/Lukas/repos/incomparable/data/incomparable_master.rds")
incomparable_master_wide <- readRDS("/Users/Lukas/repos/incomparable/data/incomparable_master_wide.rds")
```

These plots very either to convoluted or not nice enough for the final analysis, but complex enough to warrant being kept somewhere.

# Weeklyness

```{r}
incomparable_master_wide %>%
      filter(year == 2015) %>%
      select(-summary) %>%
      mutate(week = week(date)) %>%
      group_by(podcast, year, week) %>%
      tally %>%
      ggplot(aes(x = week, weight = n)) +
