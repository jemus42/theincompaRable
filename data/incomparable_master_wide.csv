It’s a genre with a puzzle at the middle, but which takes many forms across all media. Many mystery elements have also percolated out into mainstream fiction and media.

This show will be “genre for people who aren’t genre snobs,” where we will talk books, comic books, television, movies, audio plays, theatre, and more, and stretch boundaries while staying true to the form. We may even play mystery games. We’ll have a number of book-club episodes, too, and announce choices ahead of time so listeners can weigh in or read along.

In this inaugural episode, your host and several panelists describe what sucked them into reading and watching mysteries, and their favorites, and we all discuss what salient factors turn a story into a mystery.

In the North, there’s a touching family moment under a Flayed Man banner that gives us even more name confusion than usual for Westeros. Sansa becomes a real woman by committing perjury. Arya gets a belly laugh. Tyrion tells a very perplexing story involving beetles to Jaime. And finally, the most Inigo Montoyaesque trial-by-combat scene possible"
